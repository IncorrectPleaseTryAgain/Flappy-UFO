# Flappy-UFO

 ```
First Unity Project
```

This was my first ever Unity project as well as my first game that I have ever finished and built an executable for. This game 
resembles the hit mobile game flappy bird except all of the art was done by me using ``` Asperite ```. 

## Inspiration
Yes! I did watch a

and followed it in order to compelete the project.
